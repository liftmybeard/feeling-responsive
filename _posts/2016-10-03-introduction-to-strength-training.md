title: "Introduction to Strength Training"
teaser: "I often see people mistakenly thinking that building muscle mass means getting stronger. While this might seem logical at first, it's actually true only to some extent. You see, in the early stages of training, getting both bigger and stronger is an inevitable part of the process, making it apparently easy to think that they're proportional. The more you go on though, the more you'll come to realize that the two depend very little from one another. You can build mass without becoming noticeably any stronger just as much as you can get stronger without gaining a lot of weight."

##### So how is Strength training any different?


To keep things simple, while Bodybuilding routines are all about hypertrophy in order to stimulate muscle growth, strength training focuses exclusively on how much weight you can lift. Needless to say, each method requires a different approach. Generally speaking, a strength program is centered around big, compound movements that recruit a large number of muscles in order to lift heavier weights. Isolation is not the goal here, so the core movements that any program will incorporate are the "Big 4", which are respectively: the Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press and Overhead Press. Variations or Assistance exercises are also used to aid your main lifts by working the same muscles, but in a different way, which can be very useful if used properly.

##### A bit of detail


The most common, yet effective method there is for strength and endurance is probably a 5x5 or 3x5 training program. Regardless 
of how the training days are split, the recurring factor is that each session will have you perform at least one main lift using an established weight (usually a percentage of your 1RM) that you are able to lift for a constant number of reps each set. The low rep-range will allow you to work with a much higher intensity (aka more weight), thus putting out more total volume. Rest period is not so important as long as you can progressively load more weight each week with proper form and without failing.

Remember, programs are made to be flexible. That's why I recommend taking it a step further by reading and understanding the theory that goes behind a routine on a spreadsheet. Fortunately, most programs are not just two page documents and the authors were generous enough to make an actual book out of it. Here are a few that I feel are worth mentioning: 

- Starting Strength by Mark Rippetoe
- Practical Programming by Mark Rippetoe
- StrongLifts 5x5 
- The Texas Method by Justin Lascek  

##### In conclusion...


While this type of training might not be suited for everyone (due to the higher technical demand) I personally find it to be motivating, making me feel strong both in and out of the gym. Just make sure you know what you're doing, so take it lightly at first: injury is the greatest of all setbacks. With consistency, strength will build up very quickly.

Now it's your turn, get out there and go have some fun! Thanks for reading, I hope this was helpful.
