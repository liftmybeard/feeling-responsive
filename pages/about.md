Hi! My name is Michele Feltre and I'm 24 years old. I'm a full-time Software Engineer, but I also have another big passion: lifting heavy weights. :) For the past 4 years I've dedicated a lot of my time reading, understanding and applying the mechanics of sports such as Powerlifting and Strongman to my own training routine in order to become stronger, but also wiser.

# What is Lift My Beard?
------

Lift My Beard is not just a YouTube channel or a Website: it is my very own project where I share content and information that I believe to be useful and educational for anyone who wants to learn more about weight and/or strength-oriented training.
